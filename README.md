**Hey there! I'm a first-year Computer Science student 🚀👩‍💻
I'm currently diving deep into the world of computer science, learning the fundamentals like programming, algorithms, and systems. As a beginner, I’m building my skills with languages like Python 🐍, Java ☕, and C++ ⚙️. I’m especially excited about applying what I learn through hands-on projects, and I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies along the way.

My Projects:
Minecraft SMP Server ⛏️: I built and managed a custom Minecraft server, including a website to showcase features and provide updates.

Discord Bots 🤖: I’ve created feature-rich Discord bots using Python and Node.js, with features like economy systems 💰, moderation tools ⚖️, and fun community commands 🎉.

I’m always open to adapting and learning more about programming, as well as exploring new areas in the tech world. Whether it's mastering a new language, working with cutting-edge tools, or collaborating on bigger projects, I’m constantly looking for ways to grow and expand my skills. 🌱

If you’re interested in any of my projects or want to connect, feel free to reach out! ✨
